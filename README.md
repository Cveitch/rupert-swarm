Rupert squads are Ruperts that have been elected to be mobile anchors.
Squads coordinate movements and directions amongst each other.
In this way they act as reference points for all other Ruperts in range.


NOTE: Right now, the squad behaviour function form_up does not work correctly.
There is nothing stopping all squad members from moving simultaneously.
What we require is the following:
All squad members stop moving.
Mac 0 does not move.
Mac 1 moves first and attempts to get in range of Mac 0.
Mac 2 moves second and attempts to get in range of Mac 0 and Mac 1.

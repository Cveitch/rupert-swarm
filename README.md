Rupert squads are Ruperts that have been elected to be mobile anchors.
Squads coordinate movements and directions amongst each other.
In this way they act as reference points for all other Ruperts in range.


NOTE:

THINGS TO DO:

Actually send the Feather commands in mobility.py.

Every function in wireless_control.py needs implementation.
